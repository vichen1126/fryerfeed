The application name (something creative): FryerFeed

Team Overview(name/GitHub username): Jishan Alam/jotalam, Victor Chen/vichen1126, Mac Owusu/MacOwusu, Ashraful Hoque/evan175

Innovative Idea: The idea for FryerFeed is inspired by the ever-growing popularity of the air fryer as a culinary appliance. Through FryerFeed, users will be able to share pictures of their air fryer creations aswell as details about their recipe such as ingredients, cook time, temperature, whether or not the recipe requires you to flip your food during the cook, additional instructions, and if the meal is vegan and/or halal. Any posts made to FryerFeed can be seen by any and all who access FryerFeed. Each post will have a like button feature, allowing users to see the overall consensus on the quality of the recipe.

Data:
- Ingredients: A list on ingredients necessary for each recipe post and the amounts for each ingredient 
- Cook Time: The amount of time the recipe should be cooked for in the air fryer
- Temperature: The temperature the recipe should be cooked at
- Flip: Whether the recipe requires you to flip during cook, and if yes, at what amount of time
- Dietary Compliance: Whether the recipe is Kosher, Halal, Vegetarian, etc.
- Like count: An integer representing how users view the quality of the recipe (like: +1)

Functionality: 
- A feed for users to view new recipes posted to the app
- A seperate page containing a form users can fill out to make a new post
